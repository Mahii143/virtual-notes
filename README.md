**Can virtual notes fill the boots of in person notes?**

**Problem Statement:**

Develop an app or web application that increases productivity in online classes that also increases the involvement of students in learning

**Overview of the problem addressed:**

Online learning conditions have grown in demand and application in educational settings. Usage of those tools continues to grow, placing continued demand on instructional designers to develop appropriate applications of those information and communication technologies for the advantage of learners. The devices and their software didn't necessarily arise with educational purposes in mind but they find their way into educational settings, nonetheless. This project will satisfy the requirements to enhance productivity in online classes.


**Proposed Solution:**

Even though the virtual classroom is more lenient during the pandemic, we find it difficult to cope up with it for various reasons .., what’s our biggest problem nowadays apart from covid, for students like us it definitely must be online classes and trying to comprehend what they are teaching is the biggest struggle .., and that’s what this application will do by making it easier, smaller and smarter. have u missed online classes we would have missed it, and who will have the mood to watch those boring 1 hr lectures again, but if you like to read something, and u r a book worm, if u r a kindle lover then this is definitely for u .., this voice to text option will instantly give us and convert teachers words into notes, and one step forward, it eventually highlights important words.., which makes the process of taking notes easier.., what better notes do we want if we have the notes of teachers .., in this modern world, we like everything instant, instant noodle, instant coffee add to that list instant notes.., recent times basically what everyone needs in the world is choices ..,  and this is an extra choice for them, giving them an extra option .., if u want to see the video again u can, u have no mood for that, want to read it in script mode, and this is what it does .., and that’s how it helps the students and  make their online class life ends with less stress and less burden with less pressure and in  recent advancements in technologies, online learning has become a major part of the day-to-day scenario. In that concern, new features are being developed now and then in this case online learning portal has a lot of competitions, there are lot of options to choose where Google meet and zoom are playing a major role so to improve the productivity of the students while listening to the online classes we have developed some ideas for instances we have created a web application that converts the voice into the text by using it students have no worries about taking notes once the session is over the notes can be downloaded as a pdf and to analyze the attention of the listeners to keep them listening we have developed an attendance sheet which will automatically track the presence of the students these are the initial steps which are taken by us in future we can upgrade our web application. To create this web application we have imported two source codes namely engodings.idna and speech_recognition as sr by using python IDLE in brief encodings.idna module contains a few functions for handling internationalized domain names. Whenever an internationalized domain name contains non-ASCII characters, they are converted into an ASCII-compatible encoding to interact with systems such as DNS and speech_recognition is a module that is used to import a microphone to recognize the voice and give the text as an output by using these two source code we have developed an initial web application for further processing we would complete the project and enhance the features.
